# Introduction

This is a quickstart example of how to use the ETOPay SDK to create a new wallet and generate the first receiver address.

## Installation

The ETOPay SDK is available on NPM, making it easy to integrate into your project. You can find it here: [ETOPay SDK on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@etospheres/etopay-sdk-wasm).

To install it as a dependency, simply run the following command in your project directory: 

```bash
npm install @etospheres/etopay-sdk-wasm
```

This will add the ETOPay SDK to your project, and you'll be ready to start using it (as it is already done in this example)! ðŸ˜Š

## Getting started

- Copy the .env.example file to .env and set the missing values
- Go to `https://etopayapp.etospheres.com` and get the SDK configuration for you project
- Set the SDK configuration in `src/index.ts`
- Run the example with `ts-node src/index.ts`
