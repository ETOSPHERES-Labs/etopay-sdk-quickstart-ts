# Introduction

This is a quickstart example of how to use the ETOPay SDK to create a new wallet and generate the first receiver address. The _web-example_ is developed with `NextJs`.

## Installation

The ETOPay SDK is available on NPM, making it easy to integrate into your project. You can find it here:  

* Web - [ETOPay SDK Web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@etospheres/etopay-sdk-wasm-web).

To install it as a dependency, simply run the following command in your project directory: 

```bash
pnpm install @etospheres/etopay-sdk-wasm-web
```

This will add the ETOPay SDK to your project, and you'll be ready to start using it (as it is already done in these examples) ! ðŸ˜Š

## Getting started

- Copy the .env.example file to .env and set the missing values
- Go to `https://etopayapp.etospheres.com` and get the SDK configuration for you project
- Set the SDK configuration in `src/pages/index.js`
- Run the web example with `pnpm run dev`

#### Running Locally #### 

To run the web example locally, you need to:

*  Enable _CORS_ for your Keycloak setup. Therefore, go to the **Clients** section in the Keycloak Admin Console, select your client and add `http://localhost:8080` to the **Web Origins** field in the **Settings** tab.
* Specify the _redirect URL_ to `http://localhost:8080/api/callback` in the **Valid redirect URIs**.

Save your changes, and this will allow your app to communicate with Keycloak properly while using the **Standard flow**.

## Snippets

Curl snippet to get an access_token.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://auth-etopay.etospheres.com/realms/<realm>/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "grant_type=password" \
     -d "scope=profile email openid" \
     -d "client_id=<client_id>" \
     -d "client_secret=<client_secret>" \
     -d "username=<user_name>" \
     -d "password=<user_password>"
```
